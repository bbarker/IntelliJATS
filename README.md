## Important Notes for Development

Before working with this project, you'll want to follow
the prerequisites found in the [IntelliJ Documentation]
(https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Prerequisites).

If you plan to try using the PSI parser or possibly other
parts of the PSI toolkit, you'll need to mark the `gen` folder as a
"Sources Root" in IntelliJ.
